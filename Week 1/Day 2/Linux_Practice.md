1) Create a directory titled "activity"

2) Create a file called "file1.txt" inside of activity

3) Using one of the text editors, write "Hello Big Data!  Welcome to my first file!" inside of file1.txt

4) Inside activity, create a new directory titled "files"

5) Move file1.txt into the files directory

6) Print the contents of that file to the terminal

7) Inside of activity, create a new directory titled "copies"

8) make a copy of file1.txt and place it into copies

9) Change the name of the file in copies to "file2.txt" and change its contents to say "Hello Big Data!  Welcome to my first file!"

10) Print the contents of file2.txt to the console

11) Change the permissions of file1.txt so that only the owner can read the file and no one else can read, write, or execute.
