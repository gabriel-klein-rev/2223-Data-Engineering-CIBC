# Computer Basics

## Processor
    - Brain of your computer
    - Runs commands written in machine code

## Storage (HDD, SSD)
    - Long term memory
    - Only part of your computer that preserves data after you shut it down

## Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory)
    - Short term memory
    - Fast
    - Where inputs/outputs of commands are stored, and where your running programs are "stored"

## OS (operating system, Windows, MacOS, Linux)
    - Linux
    - Many big-data tools work only/better on Unix-like OS

## Kernel
    - Core of our OS
    - Controls all tasks of the system

## Terminal/Shell/CLI
    - Interface that allows us to communicate with the kernel

## Node
    - Single machine inside a cluster

## Cluster 
    - Network of multiple systems (nodes) that work together as a single unit

## VM (virtual machine)
    - Like running an OS on hardware, but on virtual "hardware"
    - Resources are allocated from actual hardware remotely to run a VM
