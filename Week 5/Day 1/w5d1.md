We will go over this on Tuesday. Feel free to use the W5D1 schema.

## Project work

Make sure to meet with your team to discuss responsibilities for the project. For the presentation (on Thursday), I would like to see your code used to process the data, an explanation of the process for cleaning the data, the dataframes/tables created as your "gold level" data (data from where you make your final queries), your queries to answer the analytics questions from the project spec, and your answers. You do not need to provide a strict medallion architecture, ERD, visuals for this presentation.
